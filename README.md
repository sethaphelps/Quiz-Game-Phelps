# Movie Trivia Game

For this assignments I created an application to play a quiz game related to movie trivia. 

- When the start button is selected a movie trivia question is presented to the user with four multiple choice options as responses. 

- If the correct one is selected they receive a point on the scoreboard. 

- If not, they receive a score in the incorrect section of the scoreboard and 5 seconds are deducted from the time. 

- The game ends if the user runs out of time or all the questions are completed. 

- The user will enter their intials at the end of the game and can either attempt the game again or close out.

- If the user decided to play again their information is stored in local storage. 

- They can reset their score by pressing the reset button on the scoreboard.
